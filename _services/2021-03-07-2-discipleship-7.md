# Source and Use of the Bible

## How did we get the Bible?
- Revelation - God spoke to man - John 17:14, Ephesians 3:2-6

- Inspiration - Man wrote God's words down - 2 Peter 1:20-21; 2 Timothy 3:16

- Preservation - The words were copied perfectly - 1 Peter 1:23-25, Psalms 12:6-7, Matthew 5:17-18

- Illumination - The words sink into your heart

    - God provides light (understanding or guidance) - Psalm 119:105, Proverbs 20:27

    - No other teacher is required - John 14:26, John 16:13, 1 John 2:27

## What do we do with the Bible?

Should it set on a shelf and collect dust?

- Study - 2 Timothy 2:15

    - Preparation - Ezra 7:10, Matthew 7:7, James 1:5, 1 Corinthians 14:37, Matthew 11:25; 1 Corinthians 2:13-16

    - A quiet place, somewhere you and God can be alone and do business.

    - Diligence - keep at it. God's Book knows you and works with you where you are to get you where God wants you.

    - Daily - Acts 17:11

                    - Historical
                    - Inspirational

                - Four uses of all Scripture:
