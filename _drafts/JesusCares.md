 "__Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light__" [Matthew 11:28-30](https://av1611.com/kjbp/kjv-bible-text/Mt-11.html?vhl=28-30).

In times like these, it is easy to get caught in a cycle of fear, anxiety, and depression. With all that is going on, remember that God loved you enough to die for you, and He lives today to comfort, lead, and guide you. Being cooped up in social isolation is a great time to spend time with God reading and praying. We want to encourage you to help those around you as best you can and to follow the guidelines we've been given ("__Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake__" [1 Peter 2:13](https://av1611.com/kjbp/kjv-bible-text/1Pe-2.html?vhl=13)). We also want to encourage you to draw close to God ("__Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you__" [James 4:8](https://av1611.com/kjbp/kjv-bible-text/Jas-4.html?vhl=8)). God still cares about you.

"__We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;__" [2 Corinthians 4:8](https://av1611.com/kjbp/kjv-bible-text/2Co-4.html?vhl=8)

"__Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.__" [John 14:27](https://av1611.com/kjbp/kjv-bible-text/Joh-14.html?vhl=27)
