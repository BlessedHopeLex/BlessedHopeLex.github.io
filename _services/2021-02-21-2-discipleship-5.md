# Why do we need the Bible?

## The Bible reveals God. 
Without the Bible, man is left to his own imagination. What is God like?
### Natural attributes
- Omniscience - God knows everything. - Job 37:16, Psalms 147:5, 1 John 3:20

- Omnipotence - God is all powerful. - Job 42:1-2, Matthew 19:26, Luke 1:37

- Omnipresence - God is everywhere. - Jeremiah 23:23-24, Psalms 139:7-12

- Immutability - God never changes. - 2 Timothy 2:13-14, Malachi 3:6, James 1:17, 1 Samuel 15:29, Hebrews 13:8

- Trinity - God is 3-in-1.

    The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are co-equal yet separate. 1 John 5:7, Matthew 28:19, Isaiah 48:16, Genesis 1:26, Genesis 3:22, 2 Corinthians 3:17, Acts 20:28, John 1:1

### Moral attributes
- Holiness - God has no evil in Him. - Isaiah 57:15, Psalms 99:9, Habakkuk 1:13, 1 Peter 1:15-16

- Righteousness and Just - God will not do wrong. - Psalms 116:5, Ezra 9:15, Jeremiah 12:1, Psalms 89:14

- Love and Mercy - Psalms 103:8, Psalms 86:15, 1 John 4:8

### What is God's plan?
God wants to have a relationship with man (fellowship). He does this through the person of Jesus Christ. He wants to get glory, honor, and power from the people He created. He deserves them, they belong to Him.
- Glory - Revelation 4:11, Psalms 19:1, Psalms 72:19, Isaiah 45:18

- Honor - Psalms 66:1-4, Psalms 95:1-7

- Power

    God manifests His power through us. He gets glory by accomplishing His will through us. 2 Corinthians 4:6-7

God created an everlasting kingdom. The theme of the Bible is the King and His Kingdom. God's Kingdom is split into two kingdoms: the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of Heaven (they are different).

Isaiah 9:6-7

Luke 1:33

Daniel 2:44

## The Bible reveals Satan

The enemy of God who seeks God's position. He desires worship. He wants to be equal with God. He is a deceiver. 

1 Peter 5:6-8

2 Corinthians 2:11

2 Corinthians 10:4-6

2 Corinthians 11:3

Ephesians 2:2

Ephesians 6:11-16

1 Timothy 3:6-7

### Where did Satan come from?

Ezekiel 28:11-13

- He was created to protect God's holiness - Ezekiel 28:14-19

- He was cast out of Heaven because of rebellion - Isaiah 14:12-15
