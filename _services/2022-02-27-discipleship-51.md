## Pitfalls of Christianity

1 John 2:15-17

Two big problems a Christian will have to face:
1. Unforgiveness
2. Living with your own sinfulness

### Worldly Influence

- 2 Corinthians 2:11
- 1 Peter 5:8
- 2 Timothy 4:10
- Colossians 4:14

2. Peers
    - Embarrassed 
        - You don't know what to say.
        - They don't know what to say.
    - The Gospel is foolishness to them that perish
    - They may be uncomfortable.
    - They may be looking for your mistakes.
    - Group dynamics
        - You are the minority.
        - Maybe they really are interested but afraid to ask in front of everybody.

3. Boss
    - May hold your job over your head.
    - May keep you back from promotion.
    - Who do you submit to?
        - God or man?

4. Old Habits
    - Besetting sin - Hebrews 12:1
    - Strong influence - Romans 6:13-19
        - Many years of sinful habits to overcome.
    - Keep your body under subjection - 1 Corinthians 9:27
        - Make if mind.

5. Old Desires
    - Can't forget the old memories, the flesh fights you - Philippians 3:13
    - Your flesh remembers the old bad times better than they were (nostalgia) - James 1:24


### Religious Influence

1. False Religion
    - You will have to get past bad or wrong teaching.
        - The older you are, the longer you were in it, the harder it is.
        - 2 Peter 2:1-3
        - 1 John 4:1
    - False teachers prey on weak Christians.
        - They usually have zeal.
        - They seem to be doing something.
        - They sound good.
            - Salvation by works appeals to a man's pride.

2. Non-church groups
    - God set up the church as the means of reaching the world.
    - Non-church, religious groups weaken the church - Masons, Elks, etc.
        - They take up time, talent, treasure.
    - They change the priority from being Bible-focused.
        - Relationship with the Lord
        - Soul-winning
        - Missions

3. Christian Media
    - Weak in doctrine
        - Try to appeal to everyone
        - Minimize differences
    - False teachings
        - Of necessity need lots of money.
        - Weaken the church.
            - TV pastors. Where are they when you have a personal need?
        - Turn unsaved people off.
        - New Christians think it is spiritually motivated.

4. Religious scholarship
    - Questions the authority of the Bible - 2 Peter 1:16
    - Put man in judgment over God and His word - pride.
        - 2 Peter 3:3-6
    - Education becomes more important that God.
        - 2 Timothy 3:4-7
        - 1 Timothy 6:20
