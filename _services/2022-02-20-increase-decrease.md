John 3:25-30

Let's brag on the Lord Jesus Christ, and get me out of the way.

Matthew 11:11, Matthew 3:1-4, Mark 1:7-8

Do I:
- Increase Him?
- Decrease myself?
- Decrease Him?
- Increase myself?

He must increase 
- in our estimation
- in our appreciation

He is
- worth it
- worthwhile

Colossians 3:8-9, Ephesians 4:22

If you decrease, you will put off the old man.

1. Who benefits from Jesus Christ increasing and me decreasing?
    - It is not for God's benefit.
    - The biggest benefit is for the child of God themselves.
    - It is also for those who hear you.
2. How does Jesus increase, and I decrease?
    - Submit yourself to God. 1 Corinthians 6:19-20
    - Pour Bible in.
3. Why lift up Jesus Christ?
    - So people can clearly see Him. Hebrews 11:27, John 12:32, Hebrews 2:9
        - Naturally, people only see themselves.
4. What does it produce?
    - Great love for Him. 1 Peter 1:8


When we lift ourselves up, the world will compare themselves to us. We aren't much to compare with.

When we lift Jesus Christ up, everyone and everything pales in comparison. There is no comparison. 

Matthew 15:8

1 Corinthians 6:19-20

Colossians 1:18

Galatians 2:20

Galatians 5:24

Proverbs 13:10
