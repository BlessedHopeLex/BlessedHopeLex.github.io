## Intent
The idea for these posts is to be short "devotionals" to post onto social media sites (Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, etc.).

## Target Audience
The primary target audience is Scriptural babies. These would be people who don't know, are confused, and/or are looking. They would be someone who has trusted Jesus Christ but never grown.

The target audience is __not__: those of other denominations, those of other religions, those who use other versions of the Bible, atheists, etc. Some of the target audience may fall into those categories, but those categories are not the aim. Arguing over the Internet is rarely a good idea, so that is not our goal.

## Rules and Guidelines
I'd like for them to stick to a few "rules" or guidelines:

1. They should not be very long. I'm not sure exactly what my "limit" will be yet (I intend to set either a word count or some other metric to try to stick to. It won't have to be a hard limit, but we should never go far over, and only for good reason), but I don't want these to be long articles.
2. They should be based around Scripture, not just one verse to go along with a thought. I always want to have Scripture quotes in bold letters to make them stand out. It is Scripture that works on people's heart, not our outlines.
3. They should be Scriptural milk, not meat. These aren't supposed to be doctrinal treatises. The target audience can't handle that.
