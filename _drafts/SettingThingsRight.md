Asking God, "What do you want me to do?" and being willing to do whatever He wants is a first step to setting things on the right path. That implies an ability to get an answer from God. That means:

b. You pray and ask, but any advice has to pass a).
c. You can ask other people for advice, but any advice has to pass a).
