# Prayer

## The model prayer for disciples

The model that Jesus gave to the disciples (the Disciples' Prayer, not the Lord's Prayer) - Luke 11:2-4
    
1. Recognize the sovereignty of God (vs 2)
2. Recognize the work of God (vs 2)
3. Recognize your needs (vss 3, 4)
4. It changes us.

## How does prayer work?

1. Prayer works on our desires.
    - Matthew 6:33
    - Hebrews 13:5
    - Philippians 4:11-19

2. Prayer works on our thoughts.
    - 2 Corinthians 10:5

3. Prayer works on our understanding.
    - Daniel 9:17-23

4. Prayer works on our actions.

## Prayer changes circumstances

Genesis 18:14, Habakkuk 1:14-16

1. Peter freed from prison - Acts 12:5
2. Cornelius and Peter brought together - Acts 10:30
3. Natural laws suspended
    1. The sun went backward 10 degrees - 2 Kings 20:5-12
    2. The sun stopped for a battle - Joshua 10:12-14
4. The sick are healed
5. Devils obey - Matthew 17:19-21

## Can prayer change God's mind?

Jonah 3:9-10, Exodus 32:10-14

What does it mean for God to repent? These verses show that God works within the free will of men. His ultimate plan and purpose are unchangeable.

## When should you pray?

- Daily
- In the morning
- In the evening
- Always, without ceasing
- Instantly - like Nehemiah 2:4
- In time of need - Hebrews 4:16

Always be in a place where you can pray. Never be in a place where you cannot pray.

- Psalms 86:3
- Psalms 5:3
- Psalms 55:17
- 1 Thessalonians 5:17

## Where should you pray?

1. Everywhere - Always be in a position to pray. 1 Timothy 2:8
2. In groups - Acts 12:5-12
3. In secret - Matthew 6:6

## Will God hear your prayer?

John 9:31
1. He will if you are saved.
2. He will if you exercise faith.
    - Sincere - Matthew 6:5
    - Not hypocritical
    - Importunity - Luke 18:1-6, Luke 11:1-13
    - Perseverance - Matthew 26:40-41
    - Fervent - James 5:16
    - Fasting - Matthew 17:21, 1 Corinthians 7:5
3. He will if you obey His commandments. 1 John 3:22
4. He will if you ask according to His will - 1 John 5:14
5. He will if you are willing to forsake your sins - James 4:3
6. He will if you are in harmony with your spouse - 1 Peter 3:7
7. He will if you ask in Jesus' name - John 5:16, John 14:13, 1 Timothy 2:5

The Holy Spirit translates, knowing our heart - Romans 8:26

## Will God answer your prayer?

Yes, but...

After you pray, look and listen for God's answer.
When you pray, be willing to accept to what God says.

1. Sometimes immediately - Daniel 9:19-23
2. Sometimes He says "wait"
3. Sometimes He says "no"
4. Sometimes He says "yes," but differently than you expected

## What happens if you don't pray?

1. You are disobedient
2. You suffer loss
    - Of power
    - Of victory
    - Of testimony
    - Of fellowship

2 Corinthians 10:4
