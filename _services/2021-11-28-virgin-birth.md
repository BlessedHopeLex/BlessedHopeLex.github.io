- 1 Timothy 3:16 - One of the greatest verses in the Bible on the Deity of Jesus Christ. All the new Bible replace "God" with "he". If Jesus was not God, then there would be no resurrection. If Jesus was not God, then He could not have come up of His own power.

- Jeremiah 22:27-30 - This ended the ability of the human line of David to rule in Judah. Without a virgin birth, God would have contradicted Himself: He said the Messiah would come from David's line (Luke 1:32), but then cut off David's line. The virgin birth fixed the issue: the seed goes through the male line, but Jesus came from David through His mother and had no father.

- Psalm 110:1-2

- Matthew 22:42-45

- Genesis 3:15

- Isaiah 7:14 - Immanuel means "God with us."

- Matthew 1:20-23

- Matthew 1:18,25 - Joseph was not Jesus' father.

- John 8:41-42 - The Pharisees did not believe Jesus was virgin-born.

- Luke 1:26-37

Without the virgin birth Jesus could not be our Savior. He would be a man like anyone else and would need a Savior, too. He was virgin born, completely God and completely man. He was completely man and dealt with human life just like you do. He was completely God and is able to bridge the gap between us and Himself.
